<h2>Q and A</h1>

Q: Why is nothing in this repo?

A: Work is in Progress.

Q: is itux.sh available for linux?

A: No, it's only available for macOS versions that checkra1n 0.10.2-beta supports, no linux versions for now.

Q: Why is it only compatible with three devices (iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPod touch 7th gen)?

A: Because it was easy to crack the A10 chip, check which drivers for all iPhones booted to Linux are supported [Here](https://projectsandcastle.org/status/)

Q: Cool! I would like to install a game console emulator in Ubuntu in the iPhone, is that possible?

A: Don't get your hopes up too high, as GPU isn't supported, and Sound isn't supported too, same with camera and cellular, everything else works.
